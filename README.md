#### Discerption 

üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The program can manage your files and programs. It offers four options: lock and unlock, backup, and autorun. The lock and unlock feature encrypts and decrypts your files. The backup option saves your files for future use, and the autorun option sets any program to run when Windows first opens. I hope you like my program; it is designed for educational purposes.
